1. p.373: EEG Mismatch negativity data (mmn)
-Data recorded with Biosemi system at 128 scalp electrodes and sampling rate of 512hz
-Vert/horiz eye movements monitored using EOG electrodes

Preprocessing:
-Conversion
--Select EEG channels used in experiment
-Montage
--derive vertical/horizontal EOG channels by subtracting pairs of channels located above/below the eye and below/lateral to the eye respectively
--also changes recording reference to be the average of all EEG channels
-Prepare
--link the data to sensors which are located in a coordinate system
-High-pass filter
--removes unwanted frequency bands from data (for evoked response analysis, high frequencies are assumed to carry noise)
--highpass filter removes ultra-low frequencies close to DC
--lowpass filter removes high frequencies
--filter prior to downsampling because high amp baseline shifts will generate filtering artefacts
-Downsampling
--lower an unnecessarily high sampling rate for evoked response analysis 
-Epoch
--specific time-windows are extracted from the continuous EEG signal (time windows are called epochs)
-Artefact removal
--remove unwanted noise
--using threshold channels
---mark trials in which signal recorded exceed threshold as artifacts
-Averaging
--to produce an ERP
--robust averaging, compute weight by conditions

Sensor space analysis
-using Random Field theory to correct for multiple statistical comparisons across N-dimensional spaces

Source reconstruction
-Create mesh
-Coregistration (linking the coordinate system of sensors to the image)
-Forward model (computing for each of the dipoles the effect it would have on sensors)
-Inverse reconstruction (MIP displayed)

Dynamic Causal Modeling
-DCM for ERP fits a neural network model to EEG data, in which activity in source regions is described using DEs based on neural mass models
-Data specification, specification of electromagnetic model, specification of neuronal model
