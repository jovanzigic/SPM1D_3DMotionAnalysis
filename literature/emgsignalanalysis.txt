EMG signal analysis

EMG signal detection issues:
1. signal to noise ratio
2. distortion (relative contribution of frequency)

Maximization of quality of EMG signal:
1. signal to noise ratio contains highest amount of info from EMG signal and minimumm noise
2. distortion must be minimal 

Electrical noise affecting EMG signals:
1. Inherent noise in electronics equipment
2. Ambient noise
3. Motion artifact
4. Inherent instability of signal

Factors affecting EMG signals:
1. Causative factors
--extrinsic
--intrinsic
2. Intermediate factors (influenced by causative factors)
3. Deterministic factors (influenced by intermediate factors)

Math models:
wavelet transform
time-frequency approaches
fourier transform
*wigner-ville distribution
statistical measures
higher-order stat

AI models:
Artificial neural networks
Dynamic recurrent neural networks
fuzzy logic
Genetic algorithm

EMG signal decomposition:
-wavelet spectrum matching and PCA of wavelet coefficients
--Decomposition algorithm has 4 processing stages: segmentation, wavelet transform, PCA, clustering
-nonlinear least mean square optimiztion of higher order cumulants

EMG signal processing:

1. Wavelet analysis

2. Time-frequency approach

3. Autoregressive model (AR)

4. Artificial Neural Networks

5. Higher-order statistics (estimation, normality)

Summary:
Decomposition of EMG signal by wavelet spectrum matching shows that the technique is accurate, reliable, and fast
nonlinear LMS optimization decomposition method based on HOS is also reliable in a noiseless case
FFT?
