# SPM1D_3DMotionAnalysis
Ballet Dancer Back Biomechanics Analysis using SPM1D and Pattern Recognition

1. spm1dmatlab-master - the spm directory for matlab
-should be part of the path when working with spm in matlab

2. spm1d-master - the spm directory for python

3. spm12 - the neuroimaging software

4. literature - a few articles/notes I considered beforehand

5. Back Biomechanics - contains all notes/excel files/matlab files used for the study

a) In Back Biomechanics, there are text files that I used to document all of my testing procedure

b) FM, Rotation, and Walking all have the following:
- I did not copy the Data folders that contains original excel data
- Stats folders contain output of matlab t-tests
- MAT folders contain all functions/matlab files used to create T-test results (I took out some dataset files because it was too big)
 
c) Pattern recognition folder contains all neural network training files:
- PatternRecogTrainingResults excel file contains all results from walking, rotation, and FM training and independent testing
- example and example tests are files to display how the pattern recogntion app in matlab works
- FM, rotation, and walking folders contain matlab files used to train networks
